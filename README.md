##1. Input Dataset (path.mat)
Input Dataset is N X M matrix which consists of multiple degradation paths of predicted machine health values from PDX
N: Time index
M: Path index
The machine health values of the first row should be same because all paths start at a same prediction triggering time

##2. Install
MATLAB R2018a
Global Optimization Toolbox should be installed

##3. Run
Run the main program: "MainFunction"
